For each `Occupation` it shows the occupation `Category`, how many people have this occupation `*.n` (in 1000s), median weekly earnings `*.earn`, and std. err of earnings `*.earn.se`, for everyone (`all.*`), females (`f.*`), and males (`m.*`).

# 1 (10 min)

Which of the following processes mostly likely generated the data? Does it happen on the raw scale or on the log scale?

1. The weekly wages are (independently) sampled from a normal distribution.
2. Female and male weekly wages have different means.  Within each sex, the weekly wages are sampled from a normal distribution with the same SD across sexes.
3. The occupation means are sampled from a normal distribution.  Within each occupation, the weekly wages are sampled from a normal distribution with the same SD across occupations.
4. The occupation means are sampled from a normal distribution.  Within each occupation, the female and male means are the occupation mean plus/minus a constant offset.  Within each occupation/sex combination, the weekly wages are sampled from a normal distribution with the same SD across occupation/sex combinations.

If you were to come up with just one number, of the form "women make x% of what men make", how would you do it?

```{r}
df2 <- df1 %>% mutate(diff = f.mu - m.mu)
df2 %>%
  pull(diff) %>%
  mean(na.rm = T) %>%
  exp()
df2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(diff)) %>%
  mutate(weighted.diff = diff * all.n / sum(all.n)) %>%
  pull(weighted.diff) %>%
  sum() %>%
  exp()
df2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(diff)) %>%
  mutate(weighted.diff = diff * sqrt(all.n) / sum(sqrt(all.n))) %>%
  pull(weighted.diff) %>%
  sum() %>%
  exp()
```

Do a linear regression of female ~ male wages (with appropriate transforms). What do the slope and intercept mean? Should the intercept be free to vary? What happens if you fix it?

```{r}
lm(f.mu ~ m.mu, df2)
df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(m.mu, f.mu)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# 4 (5 min)

Is there any problem with the linear regression? What's a better way to do the regression?

Hint: Think about the data generation process we are assuming and the question we want to answer.

```{r}
df3 <- tibble(
  occ.mu = rnorm(200),
  f.mu = rnorm(200, occ.mu, sd = .5),
  m.mu = rnorm(200, occ.mu, sd = .5)
)
df3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(m.mu, f.mu)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
lm(f.mu ~ m.mu, df3)

df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(all.mu, diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
lm(diff ~ all.mu, df2)
```
