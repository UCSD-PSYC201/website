```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

We will look at the `CO2` builtin dataset.

```{r}
?CO2
glimpse(CO2)
CO2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(conc, uptake, color = Plant)) +
  geom_line()
df1 <- CO2 %>% filter(conc >= 250)
```

# Problem 1

Does CO2 uptake differ across Type?

```{r}
df1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(Type, uptake)) +
  geom_violin(bw = 7) +
  geom_jitter(width = .1)
```

# 1.1 (10 min)

Do an ANOVA manually.  (Calculate the SSR, SSE, F-statistic, and p-value)

```{r}
df2 <- df1 %>% 
  mutate(overall.mean = mean(uptake)) %>% 
  group_by(Type) %>% 
  mutate(group.mean = mean(uptake)) %>% 
  ungroup()
ssr <- sum((df2$group.mean - df2$overall.mean)^2)
sse <- sum((df2$uptake - df2$group.mean)^2)
dfe <- nrow(df2) - 2
f <- ssr / (sse / dfe)
p <- pf(f, 1, dfe, lower.tail = F)
```

Confirm your calculation with `anova`.

```{r}
anova(lm(uptake ~ Type, df1))
```

# 1.2 (5 min)

Visualize the ANOVA.

```{r}
df2 %>%
  arrange(Type) %>%
  mutate(obs = 1:n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(obs, uptake)) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, overall.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = overall.mean, color = "overall mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, group.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = group.mean, color = "group mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .3, overall.mean, xend = obs - .3, yend = group.mean, color = "regression")) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs, group.mean, xend = obs, yend = uptake, color = "error")) +
  scale_color_discrete(breaks = c("overall mean", "group mean", "regression", "error")) +
  labs(color = "line type")
```

# Problem 2

Does CO2 uptake differ across Type and Treatment?

# 2.1 (3 min)

Look at whether the two main effects and the interaction are significant. Extract the p-value of the interaction.

```{r}
a1 <- anova(lm(uptake ~ Type * Treatment, df1))
a1[3, 5]
```

# 2.2 (5 min)

Visualize the ANOVA (without the interaction).

```{r}
df3 <- df1 %>% 
  mutate(overall.mean = mean(uptake)) %>% 
  group_by(Type) %>% 
  mutate(type.mean = mean(uptake)) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment) %>% 
  mutate(treatment.mean = mean(uptake)) %>% 
  mutate(type.treatment.mean = -overall.mean + type.mean + treatment.mean) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
# o.mean + (ty.mean - o.mean) + (tr.mean - o.mean)

df3 %>%
  arrange(Type, Treatment) %>%
  mutate(obs = 1:n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(obs, uptake)) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, overall.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = overall.mean, color = "overall mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, type.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = type.mean, color = "type mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, type.treatment.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = type.treatment.mean, color = "type + treatment mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .3, overall.mean, xend = obs - .3, yend = type.mean, color = "regression type")) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs + .3, type.mean, xend = obs + .3, yend = type.treatment.mean, color = "regression treatment")) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs, type.treatment.mean, xend = obs, yend = uptake, color = "error")) +
  scale_color_discrete(breaks = c("overall mean", "type mean", "type + treatment mean", "regression type", "regression treatment", "error")) +
  labs(color = "line type")
df3 %>%
  arrange(Type, Treatment) %>%
  mutate(obs = 1:n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(obs, uptake)) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, overall.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = overall.mean, color = "overall mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, treatment.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = treatment.mean, color = "treatment mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .5, type.treatment.mean, xend = obs + .5, yend = type.treatment.mean, color = "treatment + type mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs - .3, overall.mean, xend = obs - .3, yend = treatment.mean, color = "regression treatment")) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs + .3, treatment.mean, xend = obs + .3, yend = type.treatment.mean, color = "regression type")) +
  geom_segment(aes(obs, type.treatment.mean, xend = obs, yend = uptake, color = "error")) +
  scale_color_discrete(breaks = c("overall mean", "treatment mean", "treatment + type mean", "regression treatment", "regression type", "error")) +
  labs(color = "line type")
```

# 2.3 (5 min) Multicolinearity

Does changing the order of the predictors change the SSR (and F-statistic and p-value) of each main effect?

```{r}
anova(lm(uptake ~ Type + Treatment, df1))
anova(lm(uptake ~ Treatment + Type, df1))
df1 %>% 
  count(Type, Treatment)
```

If you drop the plant "Qn1" from the dataset, does changing the order of the predictors change the SSR (and F-statistic and p-value) of each main effect?

```{r}
df4 <- df1 %>% filter(Plant != 'Qn1')
anova(lm(uptake ~ Type + Treatment, df4))
anova(lm(uptake ~ Treatment + Type, df4))
df4 %>% 
  count(Type, Treatment)
```

How to explain this?

```{r}
df4 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Type, Treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .1, height = .1)
type1 <- as.numeric(df1$Type)
treatment1 <- as.numeric(df1$Treatment)
cor(type1, treatment1)

type4 <- as.numeric(df4$Type)
treatment4 <- as.numeric(df4$Treatment)
cor(type4, treatment4)
```

# Problem 3

## 1.1 (3 min)

Run a full ANCOVA with `conc` as the covariate.

```{r}
anc.m <- lm(uptake ~ conc + Type * Treatment, df1)
anova(anc.m)
```

## 1.2 (5 min)

Visualize the ANCOVA, with `conc` on the x axis and a line for each cell.

Hint: `predict`

```{r}
df1 %>% 
  mutate(pred = predict(anc.m, df1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(conc, color = paste(Type, Treatment))) +
  geom_point(aes(y = uptake), alpha = .5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred))
```

## 1.3 (3 min)

Test the interaction between the covariate and the categorical predictors.

```{r}
anova(lm(uptake ~ conc * Type * Treatment, df1))
```
