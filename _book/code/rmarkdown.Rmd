## Project Goals for 201a

- Get and understand a data set, and how it might answer an interesting question.  
- Have some coherent motivation  
- Make graphs of the effects.  
- Simple crude statistics to start are fine (save fancy stuff for 201b)  

## Presentations like a 10 min conference talk

- Motivation and framing!   
- Don't describe your R-coding journey  
- Show results in nice graphs, and explain them!   
- Describe your caveats and ambitions (to get useful feedback)  

## Options of how we spend our time

- Review (or Thursday)  
- R-markdown tinkering  
- Causal identification strategies  
- Help on group projects
