PSYC 193: Homework (75%), Project (25%). (no midterm or final) Details: Homework: These are entirely in R, on our online system. It makes sense to seek help from other students when you get stuck, but make sure you do everything yourself, so that you will be able to do it on your own in exams, and more importantly, real life. Exams: Midterm and Final (both take home). Working together on exams is prohibited. Group project: You will analyze some data, write a final report, and make a presentation. Details here. 0.4 Resources Class Slack: Sign up here. All class communication will be here. Anonymous feedback form: here Please tell us how we are doing (lectures, labs, assignments, etc.) What are we doing well? What can we do better? What are we are spending too much or too little time on? What are you having trouble with? Etc. Homework assignments: login Login is your ucsd username, password is full student ID, including letter. Readings: Generally we will draw on a number of sources, and our own notes, as needed for whatever we are covering. Software: We are using R and the Rstudio IDE. We wrote some instructions on installing these Here we provide a list of potentially helpful resources to get you started. Tutorials: In addition to various links from the schedule, here are a few general pointers: tryr.codeschool.com is a nice interactive tutorial to learn basic R. Datacamp offers great tutorials on R, etc. Khan Academy has excellent brief lessons to help you recall high school math you may be rusty on (like exponents, logarithms, etc.) "],["schdeule-201a.html", "201a Schedule 0.5 Week 0: Introduction 0.6 Week 1: Data 0.7 Week 2: Visualization 0.8 Week 3: Theoretical foundations of classical statistics 0.9 Week 4: Linear model: Regression 0.10 Week 5: Linear model: Multiple regression 0.11 Week 6: Linear model: Categorical predictors 0.12 Week 7: Linear model: ANCOVA, diagnostics 0.13 Week 8: Linear model: Linearizing transforms 0.14 Week 9: Covarying errors (repeated measures / random effects) 0.15 Week 10: Review and preview", " 201a Schedule 0.5 Week 0: Introduction 0.5.0.1 Readings Basic introduction to R / Rstudio: R4DS: 1, 4, 6, 8 0.5.0.2 Homework basic R syntax tutorial 0.5.0.3 Thursday slides: intro slides: administrative slides: overview slides: advice 0.6 Week 1: Data 0.6.0.1 Readings Working with data: R4DS: 5, 7, 11, 12 Descriptive stats: [notes] Cleaning data example (code): [notes] 0.6.0.2 Homework data cleaning Due: 2020-10-14 0.6.0.3 Tuesday slides: data questions slides: projects code: basics 0.6.0.4 Wednesday More R [code] [data] 0.6.0.5 Thursday code: summary stats, tidyverse 0.7 Week 2: Visualization 0.7.0.1 Readings [notes] R4DS: 2, 3 socviz: make a plot (the rest of this book may also be useful, but we don’t have time for a thorough treatment.) 0.7.0.2 Homework data visualization Due: 2020-10-21 0.7.0.3 Tuesday slides: visualization code: ggplot 0.7.0.4 Wednesday ggplot practice [code] [answers] 0.7.0.5 Thursday 0.8 Week 3: Theoretical foundations of classical statistics 0.8.0.1 Readings Probability notes: terms basics conditional monte-carlo random-variables distribution functions expectation central limit theorem, normal NHST notes: via simulation sampling distribution basic NHST via normal power, effects bonus: via binomial 0.8.0.2 Homework NHST probability Due: 2020-10-28 0.8.0.3 Tuesday slides: probability 0.8.0.4 Wednesday Probability [code] [answers] 0.8.0.5 Thursday slides: NHST 0.9 Week 4: Linear model: Regression 0.9.0.1 Notes t-distribution t-tests (note: some of this will be covered in week 6 and week 10) bivariate data anscombe’s quartet covariance correlation ordinary least-squares regression yx,xy,pca coefficient of determination significance testing of these measures prediction regression diagnostics 0.9.0.2 Homework Regression Due: 2020-11-04 0.9.0.3 Tuesday slides 0.9.0.4 Wednesday Regression [code] [answers] 0.9.0.5 Thursday slides 0.10 Week 5: Linear model: Multiple regression 0.10.0.1 Notes multiple regression 0.10.0.2 Tuesday slides code 0.10.0.3 Wednesday Multiple regression [code] [answers] 0.10.0.4 Thursday slides 0.11 Week 6: Linear model: Categorical predictors 0.11.0.1 Readings / Notes Notes on t-tests [howell ch.13 on ANOVA] [howell ch.16 on ANCOVA] 0.11.0.2 Homework Multiple regression Due: 2020-11-20 0.11.0.3 Tuesday slides 0.11.0.4 Thursday slides 0.12 Week 7: Linear model: ANCOVA, diagnostics 0.12.0.1 Homework ANOVA &amp; ANCOVA Due: 2020-11-30 0.12.0.2 Tuesday slides 0.12.0.3 Wednesday ANOVA [code] [answers] 0.12.0.4 Thursday slides 0.13 Week 8: Linear model: Linearizing transforms 0.13.0.1 Homework Linearizing transforms Due: 2020-12-03 0.13.0.2 Tuesday slides 0.14 Week 9: Covarying errors (repeated measures / random effects) 0.14.0.1 Readings: I don’t like either of these….

This project is divided into two phases to be implemented in 201a and 201b. In 201a your goal is to identify a conjunction of an interesting question and a data source that might answer it. You will need to understand the data, clean it, make graphs of the data that might answer the question, and do simple analyses to get your bearings. In 201b you will do the more complete analyses, likely using more advanced methods that we will cover in 201b, and turn the initial report from 201a into something that could be submitted for publication. 0.16 Examples of this sort of thing skill learning in online games sequential dependence in yelp reviews stereotype threat in chess play income mobility over time scaling laws in cities crowd within in real estimation personality in blog posts neurosynth brain mapping example hashtag adoption cultural tastes via baby names You will notice that particularly successful examples usually have a combination of a few things: a coherent research question, with a good justification for why the naturalistic data maps onto theoretical constructs of interest; a novel dataset, which might mean data that had not preciously been available, or a dataset that was created by cleverly combining/co-registering previously separate datasets; and (sometimes or) a fairly sophisticated analysis that adequately grapples with the complicated structure of the data. The full project will span both 201a and 201b (previously I had it only in 201b, and that was not enough time) 0.17 201a 0.17.1 201a Timeline Figure out groups as soon as possible, so we can assist if folks are group-less. 2020-10-20: Groups due 2020-10-27: Project plan due 2020-11-10: Preliminary data summaries due 2020-12-17: (before final) Write-ups due 2020-12-17: (during final) Project presentations 2020-12-18: Group-evaluation due 0.17.2 Groups You will be in groups of ~3-5 (5 if group includes an undergrad). Undergrads should not be in a group together (should join a group of grad students). Hopefully you can self-assemble into groups, but I will help if need be. Due: 2020-10-20 Create a Slack channel titled “project-[groupname]” (can be either public or private). Invite Ed and James into the channel. Upload a CSV file about your group makeup in the channel: 1 row per group member, and columns: last_name, first_name, email, group_name. 0.17.3 201a Project plan Due: 2020-10-27 This is just a message including the following: Description: (500 words max) describe the research question(s), the data source(s), and how they are related. the data 0.17.4 201a Preliminary data summaries Due: 2020-11-10 This is an R script (ideally an R markdown file), and output showing coarse summaries of the data (histograms, scatterplots, etc). This should include various validity checks to figure out if any of the data are corrupted, if co-registration of different data sources was done accurately, etc. Send the R script and output in the Slack channel. The only goal here is to force you to look over the data to make sure you find problems early, rather than at the last minute. 0.17.5 201a Write-ups Due: 2020-12-17, before class This should be less than 2000 words, and should include: A description of the research questions: why is this an interesting/important question? Add a bit of lit review to help others understand what is already known, and what missing information your approach aims to provide. A description of the data, where it came from, any peculiarities about the data structure or collection method, etc. Graphs that try to answer the key research questions, and some explanation about why the graphs answer (or fail to answer) these research questions. Some basic statistics that attempt to quantify the answers to these research questions and the uncertainty associated with these answers (only methods covered in 201a are expected, but by all means do something fancier if you are comfortable) Some discussion about which questions are adequately answered by the methods you used, and which will require a more elaborate analysis. (e.g., we fit a regression to all the data, but we know there is important substructure that this analysis is ignoring) 0.17.6 201a Presentation Due: 2020-12-17, during final time Tell us about your results. This should be like a 10 minute conference talk: provide motivation for the question you are asking, and explain why it is worth asking describe (briefly) what was done on this question previously, and why your project fills a gap in knowledge describe the data, any peculiarities therein, and explain why it is a useful data source for answering the question. what are the linking assumptions? present your results (mostly graphs), and explain what we learn from these graphs. describe the caveats, to set the agenda for what you might try to address in 201b. The goals here are: to teach the audience (us instructors, and the rest of the class) about this research domain/question keep the audience entertained practice working through the logic tying questions to data practice making nice data visualizations in R to highlight the relevant results practice giving talks. Do not go into agonizing details about the trials and tribulations involved with your R code, your reanalysis, etc. Just give us your results. 0.17.7 201a Group-evaluation Due: 2020-12-18 After you completed your presentation, each student should independently DM Ed on Slack: your group name, and your estimate as to what percentage of the total work each member of your group did. Basically, I want to know if someone single-handedly carried your group, or if someone was a free-rider and let the rest of the group do all the work. I’m hoping that there will not be such an uneven distribution of effort, and that the mere fact that these evaluations will be sent will motivate your group not to leave you hanging. 0.18 201b In 201b you will start where you left off in 201a: fill in the missing analyses, flesh out the motivation/introduction, add a proper discussion, and hopefully, wind up with a paper that might be submitted for publication with minimal further effort. 0.19 Data sources The lists below are just pointers, you should do your own googling, and hopefully you will find something new and interesting. In general, you will get the most mileage in doing something new by intelligently combining several sources that have not already been combined for you (e.g., cross-linking crime statistics for a city with city demographics, or fluctuations in attitudes over time/geography, with voting patterns at that time/place, etc).
