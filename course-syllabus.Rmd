Details:
  
*Homework*:  These are entirely in R, on our [online system](hw/).  It makes sense to seek help from other students when you get stuck, but make sure you do everything yourself, so that you will be able to do it on your own in exams, and more importantly, real life. 

*Exams*: Midterm and Final (both take home). Working together on exams is prohibited.

*Group project*: You will analyze some data, write a final report, and make a presentation. [Details here](#course-projects).
